# Locofy-AI
I designed a website using ReactJS and LOCOFY, an AI tool that converts Figma designs to code, streamlining the development process. I extended the functionality by integrating FIREBASE Auth for secure login capabilities. This project demonstrates my proficiency in frontend development and integrating third-party tools to enhance user experience.
